// ### Count Rules

// [] - balls and strikes reset to 0 when a player reaches 3 strikes or 4 balls.
// [] - balls and strikes reset to 0 when a `hit` is recorded.
// [] - a `foul` increases strikes up to 2. With no strikes, a foul makes it 1 strike. With 1 strike, a foul makes it 2 strikes. With two strikes a foul has no effect, count stays at 2 strikes.

// ### Display

// [] - display the count of `balls` and `strikes` for the at-bat.
// [] - should be updated when the user records activity on the `Dashboard` component.

### Dashboard

[x] - provide a button that the person in charge can press every time there is a `strike`, `ball`, `foul` or `hit`.
// [x] - there is **NO** need to specify the type of hit (single, double, etc).
[x] - changes recorded on this component should update the information shown by the `Display` component.
// [] - Feel free add other components and organize and name your components any way you want to satisfy the requirements. **Make it up and make it happen developer!**.
